// functions to work with typed arrays containing x spans

// Get the x span indexes of the x spans that touch the border.

// Or filter by color etc.

// Will need to deal with different formats / standards / layouts of typed arrays.

// xyl xylc

// create the group of the outer touching pixels?
//   or set a bitfield?
// create a copy of a multi-field typed array but with a bitfield as well?

// Bitfield values could be fast and efficient.

// Get the indexes of the x spans that touch the outside???
